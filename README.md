## Android Build Scripts

### This is personal script i use to clone and start the android_build_env script from [Akil Narang](https://github.com/akhilnarang) in one shot.

##### First open a Terminal in home directory and clone the scripts repo


```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ashoss/scripts.git scripts
```

##### Then start the script ( Note: it may ask for your password )


```bash
  bash scripts/setup.sh
```

##### Let the script complete and once it is finished you will be ready for building Android/AOSP :)


###### Notes:

- The script is currently only compatible with Ubuntu/Debian distros
- The script may take a while to complete, depending on your hardware and internet speed
