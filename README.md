## Android Scripts

#### This is personal script i use to clone and start the android_build_env script [Akil Narang](https://github.com/akhilnarang) in one shot.

##### First clone the scripts repo


```bash

  git clone https://github.com/ashoss/scripts.git

```

##### Then open a Terminal and start the script ( Note: it may ask for your password )


```bash

  bash scripts/setup.sh
  
```

#### Let the script complete and once it is finished you will be ready for building Android/AOSP :)
